# AI Job Recommendation System

**An AI recommendation system that helps users get the jobs they are qualified for without going through the stress and hassle of sifting through tons of irrelevant jobs. Users can get AI recommendations straight to their emails. It uses MySQL with Sequelize ORM, JWT authentication, account verification, password recovery, job cache and rate limiter.**

---
## Tech Stack 
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MySQL + Sequelize ORM  
- **Authentication:** JWT, Bcrypt  
- **AI Integration:** Gemini API / GenAI for recommendation logic  
- **Email Service:** Nodemailer + EJS Templates  
- **Logging:** Pino Logger  
- **Caching:** Custom Redis-like caching  
---

## Key Features

- AI-Driven Recommendations — Suggests jobs based on user profiles and resumes.
- JWT Authentication — Secure user sessions and authorization.
- Email Verification & Password Recovery — Using Nodemailer and OTP-based verification.
- Profile Management — Personalized profiles to enhance job matching.
- Resume Uploads — Resume upload and parsing via Multer.
- Job Cache System — Faster access to job data with Redis-like caching logic.
- Rate Limiting — Prevents API abuse and excessive requests.
- Structured Logging — Implemented using Pino with log rotation.
- MySQL + Sequelize ORM — Smooth data modeling and management.
- Dynamic Email Templates — Beautiful EJS-based templates for user communication.

## Environment Variables (.env)

- Create a .env file in the root directory before running the application.
  
```bash
# Database credentials
DB_NAME="db name"
DB_HOST="db host"
DB_USER="db user"
DB_PASSWORD="db password"
DB_PORT=

# Auth and email
JWT_SECRET="jwt secret"
OTP_SECRET="otp secret"

EMAIL_SERVICE_SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_SERVICE_USER="youremail@gmail.com"
EMAIL_SERVICE_APP_PASSWORD="yourapppassword"
EMAIL_SERVICE_PORT=465

# External APIs
JSECRET_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=

# Application credentials
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Logger levels
PINO_LOG_LEVEL_CONSOLE=info
PINO_LOG_LEVEL_FILE=trace

```

 ## Pino Log Levels
Pino adheres to a standard severity model where each log level corresponds to a numeric value. This system is crucial for filtering logs efficiently, especially in production environments.

Logs are processed only if their level is equal to or higher (more severe) than the level configured for the logger or its targets.

| Level Name | Numeric Value | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| trace	| 10	| Debugging: Extremely detailed information, often including variable states and internal function flow. |
| debug	| 20	| Debugging: Informational events useful for developers during active development and troubleshooting. |
| info	| 30	| Standard Activity (Default): Routine confirmation that application units are operating normally (e.g., Server started, Database connected). |
| warn	| 40	| Non-Critical Issues: Potential problems that don't immediately halt execution (e.g., deprecated API use, high-latency request). |
| error	| 50	| Errors: Runtime exceptions or issues that require immediate attention but might allow the application to continue running. | 
| fatal	| 60	| Critical Failure: Severe errors that cause the application to crash or become unusable. | 


### Example usage

Instead of 
```javascript
console.log(`Server started on ${port}`)
```
You can use

```javascript
logger.info(`Server started on ${port}`)
```
*The log will be saved in the app.logs file and also outputted in the console.*

## How It Works

- A user registers and receives a verification OTP via email.
- After verification, the user can upload a resume and create a profile.
- The system analyzes skills, education, and experience using AI APIs.
- Jobs are fetched from external APIs or the database.
- The AI model matches and recommends the most relevant jobs.
- Users receive personalized job recommendations via email.
